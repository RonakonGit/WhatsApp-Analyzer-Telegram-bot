62,27/11/18,15:05, Abhijit A M," What is ""copy"" and why is it bad?. . Copy is the way we learn. Almost everything we know is through copy. Unfortunately in a competitive environment (the prime factor to be blamed), when students have to compete with each other, copying from each other is not allowed, not because it is detrimental to learning, but because on one hand the work done by you becomes your own property, and on the other hand sharing it with others goes against the rule of competition. When everyone has to be evaluated for his/her ""own"" performance, copying has to be disallowed.. . Leaving that apart, the reality is -  in a system of competition, ""copy"" is not allowed in exams, projects. etc.. . W.r.t. the DSA project, if the CODE that you have submitted, is not entirely product of your own thinking (the algorithmic part can be removed from this as many existing algorithms like compression, etc. need to be learnt - copied conceptually - from other resources), then it's a copy.  This includes copying part/complete code from web/seniors; design of the code done by others, part of code written by relatives, etc.",2018-11-27 15:05:00,Tuesday,1103,against algorithmic algorithms allowed almost and apart as bad be because becomes blamed but by can code compete competition competitive complete compression conceptually copied copy copying design detrimental disallowed done dsa each entirely environment etc evaluated everyone everything exams existing factor for from goes hand has have her his if in includes is it know learn learning learnt leaving like many need not of on one other others own part performance prime product project projects property reality relatives removed resources rule seniors sharing students submitted system that the then thinking this through to unfortunately way we web what when why with work written you your,194,,15,5.454545454545457,0.6628787878787878
